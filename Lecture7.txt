                               0                  0                    0
                               0                  1                    1

Example: Amazon => Database => Customer
                Sl. No.            Name                     Address                         Age
                   1.              Rupu                    Agarpara                          22
                   2.               Rup             Salt Lake, Sector-5                      20
                   3.             Rupayan                    Fulia                           24
                   4.               Rupi                    Newtown                          21
Syntax: select * from table_name where condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 OR so_on;
Command1: select Name from Customer where Address=”Agarpara” OR Address=”Fulia”;
Output1: Rupu, Rupayan

Command2: select Name from Customer where (Address=”Agarpara” OR Address=”Fulia”) OR (Address=”Newtown”);
Output2: Rupu, Rupayan, Rupi

[Note: Now, I want to use AND and OR operation combinedly] 
Command3: select Name from Customer where (Age>20 AND Age<25) AND (Address=”Salt Lake, Sector-5” OR Address=”Fulia”);
Ouput3: Rupayan
                                                                   -------×-------
