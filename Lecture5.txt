Order By Keyword in SQL || Order By With Real Life Example:

Order By: Order by is used to sort data or result in Ascending or Descending order.
Example: Amazon => Database => Customer
                Sl. No.            Name                Age
                   1.              Rupu                 22
                   2.               Rup                 20
                   3.             Rupayan               24
                   4.               Rupi                22
Criteria: Data is arranged by ascending order.
Syntax: select */column_name from table_name Order by column_name asc/desc;
              select */column_name from table_name Order by column_name; 
[Note: if you don’t mention asc/desc, then by default, we will give our result in ascending order.]        
Command 1: select Name from Customer Order by Age asc;
Output 1: Rup, Rupu, Rupi, Rupayan

[Note: Now, I want to sort our data in ascending order according to Age and descending order according to Name]
Command 2: select Name from Customer Order by Age asc. Name desc;
Output 2: Rup, Rupi, Rupu, Rupayan

Order By used with Where Clause:
Table: Customer
                Sl. No.            Name                Age
                   1.              Rupu                 22
                   2.               Rup                 20
                   3.              Rupayan              24
                   4.               Rupi                23
Command: select Name from Customer where Age>22 Order By Age desc;
Output: Rupayan, Rupi
