Insert Into Statement in SQL:

Insert: It is used to insert/store records/data in database/table.
Syntax1: Insert into table_name values (type_of_value1, type_of_value2, type_of_value3, so_on);
              [Note: Two types of values: Number, Integer]

Example1: Amazon => Database => Customer
                Sl. No.            Name                     Address                         Age
                   1.              Rupu                    Agarpara                          22
[Note: This is Amazon’s current database]
[Now, Three new customer named Rup, Rupi, Rupayan purchase a product from Amazon. So Amazon have to add Rupayan’s all data in their database for future purposes (Like: Upcoming Sales, Vouchers, Product Promotion etc. etc.]
Command1.1: insert into Customer values (2, “Rupayan”, “Fulia”, 24);
Output1.1:
                Sl. No.            Name                     Address                         Age
                   1.              Rupu                    Agarpara                          22
                   2.              Rupayan                  Fulia                            24

[Note: If we want to add multiple values in our table, then we can easily do it with a single command]
Command1.2: insert into Customer values (3, “Rupi”, “Newtown”, 21), (4, “Rup”, “Salt Lake, Sector-5”,  20);
Output1.2:
                Sl. No.            Name                     Address                         Age
                   1.              Rupu                     Agarpara                         22
                   2.              Rupayan                    Fulia                          24
                   3.              Rupi                      Newtown                         21

Insert Statement into specific column_name:

Command2.1: insert into Customer (“Sl. No.”, “Name”, “Address”, “Age”) values (2, “Rupayan”, “Fulia”, 24);
Output2.1:
                Sl. No.            Name                     Address                         Age
                   1.              Rupu                    Agarpara                          22
